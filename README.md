# RenderApp
A Vulcan Renderer to make 3D Applications

# Getting Started
### Clone the Repository
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jerry1177/RenderApp.git

### Platforms
We currently only support windows right now, but will support mac and linux. Make sure to set the "VULKAN_SDK" environment variable on your windows machine to the vulkan SDK directory. Once this is done, just double click on the build.bat file and a Visual Studio 2022 will be generated for you.
